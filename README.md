# Hackathon Project: Security Management Platform

## Overview

This project was developed as part of our hackathon submission. It is a web-based Security Management Platform designed to centralize user authentication, threat monitoring, activity tracking, and system configurations into one interactive dashboard. The goal of the project is to provide an intuitive and efficient interface for users to manage and monitor security-related events in real time.

## Key Features

### 🔐 User Authentication

* Secure login and signup system
* User session handling and access control

### 🛡️ Real-Time Threat Detection

* Dynamic dashboard displaying potential threats
* Status indicators for system safety and risk levels
* Threat analysis module with detailed breakdowns

### 👁️ Stealth & Activity Monitoring

* Timeline of recent system actions
* Monitoring of user behavior and security-critical events
* Visualization of stealth operations

### ⚙️ System Settings & Configuration

* Editable settings for security parameters
* Responsive UI for managing system controls
* User profile management

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** PHP (used for handling authentication and server-side logic)
* **Design Assets:** Images, icons, UI templates

## How It Works

1. Users authenticate through the login interface.
2. Once logged in, they access the main dashboard.
3. The dashboard displays:

   * System safety status
   * Threat insights
   * Recent activities timeline
4. Users can navigate to stealth mode, system monitoring, threat analysis, and settings.

## Purpose of the Hackathon Project

This project was built to demonstrate our ability to design a functional, visually appealing, and security-oriented web interface within limited hackathon time. The goal was to showcase:

* Rapid development
* Clean UI/UX
* Modular structure
* Security-focused features

## Future Improvements

* Enhanced backend integration
* Database-powered user authentication
* Fully automated threat detection engine
* AI-assisted monitoring and analysis
